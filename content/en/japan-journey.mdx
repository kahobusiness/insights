# ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Journey Through Japan

## Travel Itinerary

### Day 1

Over the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I embarked on a journey to Japan with friends. Our flight descended into Kansai International Airport, Osaka, revealing the vast ocean beneath us as we pierced through the clouds. The airport, majestically set in the midst of the sea, offered a uniquely captivating arrival experience.

Despite my initial apprehensions about language barriers complicating our entry, the immigration process was unexpectedly smooth and straightforward. The welcoming demeanor of the immigration officer, accentuated by a small, endearing gesture of lip-licking, instantly enhanced my first impression of Japan and its people.

Navigating the ICOCA card recharge machine with a friendâ€™s help, we managed to load our cards after a few minutes of confusion. Itâ€™s worth noting that the machine accepts only cash in Japanese yen.

The complexity of Osaka's JR lines, compounded by our language challenges, nearly overwhelmed us at the airport. However, after some persistence, we deciphered the route to our Airbnb. The JR lines in Japan vary in service speed, with each type bypassing a different number of stations according to its priority level. From the slow local trains stopping at every station to the rapid Ltd. Express trains connecting major hubs, navigating this system was an adventure in itself.

Our excitement was palpable as we boarded the JR train, eagerly discussing the pristine exteriors of Japanese homes, their distinctive pointed rooftops, and the enchanting streets. Yet, the quietude of our fellow passengers soon led us to lower our voices, blending into the serene atmosphere of a typical Friday afternoon.

Arriving at our Airbnb, we soon ventured out to a local ramen shop. Despite the language barrier and the absence of an English menu, Google Translate and a bit of Japanese knowledge from a friend helped us order six delicious bowls of ramen. The ramen, distinct from its Chinese counterpart, boasted a rich, savory broth with perfectly firm noodles and aromatic chashu pork, albeit less spicy than we were accustomed to. This encounter with Japanese cuisine underscored the unique charm of the country, from its food to its culture and people.

### Day 2

Our second day was dedicated to exploring Osaka, starting with Osaka Castle and then moving on to Shinsaibashi, capturing moments and soaking in the sights along the way.

The morning visit to Osaka Castle highlighted the limitations of my 55mm lens, which struggled with both expansive and detailed shots due to its focal length. Despite this challenge, the experience taught valuable lessons in photography and composition, particularly in portrait shots supported by quality equipment.

Osaka Castle was bustling with tourists, and the sound of Mandarin filled the air, reminding us of the global appeal of this historic site. A chance encounter with a couple in full kimono attire offered a glimpse into traditional Japanese culture, a moment we respectfully observed without intruding.

The sacred Shiba Inu at Osaka Castle provided a delightful interlude, demonstrating remarkable discipline as it awaited its owner's command to enjoy a treat. This encounter with Japan's beloved dog breed was a highlight of the day.

Shinsaibashi, in daylight, lacked the neon spectacle but buzzed with life and crowds, showcasing the vibrant urban culture of Osaka. Lunch at Ichiran Ramen catered more to our tastes, with options for customization and a noticeable presence of Mandarin-speaking staff and diners, adding a familiar touch to our culinary adventure.

For lunch at Shinsaibashi, we ate at Ichiran Ramen. It felt significantly more catered to Chinese tastes compared to the small ramen shop we first visited upon arriving in Japan: the flavors were more palatable, there was a Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese guide, and we could hear Mandarin spoken occasionally between the tables. <br /><br />

Ichiran Ramen offers a rich array of customizable options: the firmness of the noodles, the density of the soup, the thickness of the oil layer on the surface, and the level of saltiness, among others, with the option to add extra side dishes. Besides ramen, the matcha tofu on the right is highly recommended. It's fantastic and delicious, with the refreshing aroma of matcha and the smooth texture of tofu. The sweet taste tantalizes the taste buds, wow.

Apart from eating, Shinsaibashi is an undeniable shopping paradise. After finishing our ramen, girls went to buy cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, while boys browsed other small shops.<br /><br />

Japan truly is a paradise for enthusiasts of geek culture.There are entire floors dedicated to Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card shops, where rare cards are sold for tens of thousands of yen. There are many Surugaya like buildings: first floor is filled with video game and various toys; second floor is filled with a wide range of comics and anime DVDs; third floor for for TV dramas; top floor for 18+ content 

![1st.jpg](/japan-journey/1st.jpg)PICï¼šhammmmm....

18r In the 18+ sections, it's mostly middle-aged men, everyone coexists peacefully, quietly browsing through their preferred DVDs without disturbing each other. This serene atmosphere surprisingly gave me the feeling of searching for books in a library.

After a day of exploring, exhausted, we returned to Noda in the evening and found an Izakaya near our Airbnb. We tried some authentic Japanese plum wine and ordered a serving of tuna sashimi that looked surprisingly like beef.

In the 18+ shops, most of the customers are middle-aged men. Everyone coexists peacefully, quietly browsing through their preferred DVDs without disturbing each other. This serene atmosphere surprisingly gave me the feeling of searching for books in a library.

### Day 3

On the third day, our destination was Universal Studios Japan (USJ). We almost went through all the attractions â€” Harry Potter, The Flying Dinosaur, the rollback, Jaws, Minions, EVA battling Godzilla, and Spider-Man. The thrill rides were amazing, in two words: fun and exciting. The scenario simulation attractions were also very immersive and spectacular, with the Jaws performer putting on an enthusiastic show. Although we didn't understand much of what was said, the overflowing acting skills provided us with a great experience.

USJ is filled with many beautiful JK (Japanese high school girl) enthusiasts. While waiting in line with nothing much to do, casually glancing around often revealed several delicate and pretty faces.<br /><br />

The overall impression is that Japanese girls are very refined and beautiful, but boys still have room for improvement overall.

Japanese people tend to be introverted, strictly adhering to procedures and order. They neither wish to trouble others nor be troubled themselves, which can come across as somewhat indifferent, rarely expressing emotions easily. They are accustomed to maintaining silence in public places, so much so that you might not even notice a line forming behind you in a supermarket or while recharging a Suica card. Our Airbnb host cautioned us to keep quiet after 7 PM, mentioning incidents where guests from China were reported to the police and asked to leave due to noise disturbances at night.

Japanese people are polite and humble, but this can also make them seem distant or even elusive. However, I believe they also have a passion in their hearts; it's just expressed differentlyâ€”like the uninhibited noise in an izakaya, which may be their way of releasing the stress of the day.

My favorite photo of the day captures a Japanese couple sharing a passionate kiss in front of the globe at USJ. The moment I pressed the shutter, I felt a genuine warmth. It was this kind of straightforward, overflowing happiness that really touched me. I wish them all the best.

### Day 4

On the fourth day, we went to Nara, with the theme being "Memoirs of Being Bumped by Deer." It's unclear where Nara's deer learned to bow, but they nod in gratitude while eating food from the hands of tourists. There's a give and take, wonderfully so.

I particularly want to talk about the Airbnb we stayed in today, which was truly in the traditional Japanese style, even including two samurai swords.<br /><br />

### Day 5

On the fifth day, our destination was Kiyomizu-dera, with the theme being kimonos. Coming to Japan, trying on kimonos is a popular choice for many couples, and today, we also joined friends for a photoshoot in them.

Along the way, we saw many girls dressed in kimonos, and the Sony Î±7R III in my hands reassured me that we had indeed come to the right place.

In the afternoon, we continued to visit several temples, and as the number of tourists increased, finding a spot without people for a clear shot became increasingly difficult.<br /><br />

In the evening, we arrived in Kyoto and bought some gifts. We packed up and prepared ourselves emotionally for the return trip home.

### Day 6

Home! And we're already planning our next trip for the coming year, with Tokyo as our next destination. lol


## Thoughts

### Sony A7R3 + 55 1.8 ZA len

During this trip to Japan, I exclusively used the 55 1.8 ZA lens for photography, transitioning from unfamiliarity to familiarity with the 55mm focal length. The 55mm lens is somewhat long, making it less ideal for capturing buildings, landscapes, and scenes requiring a grand expression; it's also not long enough, which makes it less suitable for close-ups or scenes requiring compression of depth. As the old masters would say, it's like "plain boiled water"â€”a standard lens without any distinctive features.

Since it's not possible to excel through perspective with this focal length, the focus shifted to capturing subjects or stories, resulting in a selection of photos that triumph through human stories.

However, the moderate length of 55mm also has its advantages for street photography: it doesn't require getting too close to the subject, which is suitable for those who are shy; it's also not too far from models, facilitating easy communication. Of course, its biggest advantage is its portabilityâ€”the size and weight of the 55 1.8 ZA make it easy to carry all day, so I ended up not using the 24-105G lens I had prepared for the trip due to its weight, even though a zoom lens is often more versatile.

As for the A7R III, all I can say is Sony's excellence is apparent, with the only drawback being its price. The camera offers ultra-high resolution, rapid autofocus, high dynamic range, a robust viewfinder and screen, dual card slots, quick startup, and high ISO performance due to its full-frame sensor. Paired with a large aperture prime lens, it's easy to capture beautifully blurred background images.

However, relying too heavily on superior hardware can lead to a dependency on depth of field control to convey a theme, neglecting composition and spacing, which are crucial elements in mobile photography.

### Atmosphere

![Street.jpg](/japan-journey/Street.jpg)PIC: Street

The social atmosphere in Japan is distinct from that in China. There's a clear hierarchy in relationships, especially in the workplace where subordinates are expected to use honorific language when addressing superiors. The photo taken on the first night after arriving in Noda captures a scene during a street photography session, illustrating this societal aspect.

![Market.jpg](/japan-journey/Market.jpg)PICï¼šSupermarket

The Japanese people are indeed very reserved and polite. One evening, while shopping for instant curry at a supermarket, my friend and I were trying to figure out whether a particular flavor was spicy or not, as we couldn't understand the text. We accidentally blocked the aisle between shelves, hindering a lady from passing through. She stood quietly beside us, waiting until we noticed her presence. If this were in China, someone might have simply said "excuse me" or squeezed past us.

On another occasion, we were recharging our transportation cards at a JR station machine. Due to our lack of understanding of Japanese, it took us a while to successfully recharge the cards. When we finally finished and stepped away, we were surprised to find a long line had formed behind us, with no fewer than seven people waiting quietly in line. It was quite a shock to realize just how patient they had been.

## Postscript

Since I began writing this article, more than half a year has passed, a delay largely due to my procrastination. After returning from Japan, I spent over three months just editing photos. As the saying goes, shooting in the moment is fun, but selecting the best shots later can be tearfully overwhelming. As the New Year approached, I thought it wouldn't be right to drag something that should have been completed in the 2010s into the 2020s, so I made it a point to finish this piece before New Year's Eve.
