# üëã Hello, world!

Finally got this this little nextra based site up. üòÑ

Deploy with Vercel
Manage on GitHub
Using VSCode to develop the site on PC, and Typora for Markdown editing.
Connecting to GitHub repositories and managing content with Working Copy on iPad, and editing Markdown content with Tiao.

This site is essentially free (bought a domain for binding to enhance the experience), with stable service that has decent access speed all around the world. It's enjoyable to read on both PC and Mobile, allowing for multi-end synchronization and version control via git, and comfortable writing on the iPad. Overall, a quite satisfactory solution was found.

This site will periodically update with some work insights from a product manager, tool product experience sharing, travel observations, etc. Hope it can be helpful or inspiring to you ‚ù§Ô∏è.
