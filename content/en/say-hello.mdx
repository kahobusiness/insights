# üëã Hello, World!

This is a casual blog about AI, product design, and travel.

* Built with [nextra](https://nextra.site)
* Deployed via Vercel
* Hosted on GitHub
* On PC, site development is done with VSCode, and Markdown content is edited with Typora
* On iPad, Working Copy is used to connect with the GitHub repository for content management, and Tiao is used for Markdown editing

The solution is basically free (I bought a domain for a better experience), stable in service, and offers good access speed both domestically and internationally. It‚Äôs enjoyable to read on both PC and mobile. With git, multi-device synchronization and version management are possible. Writing on iPad is also a pleasure. Overall, I‚Äôve found a solution I‚Äôm quite satisfied with.

This site will be updated from time to time with insights from a product manager‚Äôs work, tool/product experience sharing, travel stories, and more. I hope it can be helpful or inspiring to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
